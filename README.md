# React GitHub user search component

My solution to [GitHub user search app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6) challenge.

An interactive component to search for GitHub users and display profile data. Besides React, only one dependency of [Day.js](https://day.js.org).

Caches requested profile data in state, preventing redundant requests.
